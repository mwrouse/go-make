# Go-Make 
Go-Make is a small, make-like, build tool inspired by make, designed to run on Windows. 

It has the basic features of make. 

# Usage 
To use download [dist/go-make.exe](dist/go-make.exe) and save it anywhere on your computer, then add the path you saved it in to your `PATH` environmental variable. 

# Basic Features 
Your make file can have: 
* Multiple sections, specified in any order that can call eachother 
* Global scoped and local scoped variables (case insensitive)
* Comments (no inline comments!)
* $(DIR) variable by default set to the working directory

Comming Soon: 
* Setting variables in command line arguments 
* Inline comments 



# The Makefile 
Below is an example of a simple go-make build script 
```makefile 
# This is a comment 
GLOBAL = I am a global variable 


section1: 
	echo $(GLOBAL)
	
all: 
	GLOBAL = I am a local variable overriding a global variable 
	echo $(GLOBAL)
	
	# Execute commands in the other section 
	section1 
```
Save this as `makefile` in your directory.

To execute this, simply use 
`go-make` in the command prompt in your working directory 


You will see the following output: 
```
echo I am a local variable overriding a global variable
        I am a local variable overriding a global variable

echo I am a global variable
        I am a global variable

Make finished
```

## Output formatting 
The output for go-make is formatted in the following way: 
```
Command 1 
	Command 1 Output

Command n

```
